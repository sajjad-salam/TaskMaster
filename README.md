## ✨ Key Features

- **Folder-based organisation** – Create, rename, delete and re-order folders any time.
- **Organize tasks** – Move tasks between folders from a floating, scrollable menu.
- **Real-time filter & search** – Filter by folder, status or free-text. Results update instantly.
- **Multi-language** – Switch between English and Spanish with one click.
- **Progress indicators** – Each folder shows a progress bar and a “tasks remaining” counter.
- **Responsive UI** – Clean, modern and mobile-friendly.
- **Truly portable** – All data lives next to the executable (`todos.db`).
- **Safe deletion** – Confirmation dialogs protect you from accidental data loss.
- **Smart limits & tooltips** – Long texts are gently truncated to keep the layout tidy.
- **Native window** – Runs in its own window via `pywebview`, not in a browser tab.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Download `TaskMaster.exe`**  
   No installer, no admin rights—just grab the file from the latest
   [release](https://github.com/AguExposito/TaskMaster/releases) and place it anywhere you like.

2. **Run it**  
   Double-click `TaskMaster.exe`. A window appears instantly and a local SQLite
   database (`todos.db`) is created beside it.

3. **Start organising**  
   Create folders, add tasks — all changes are saved automatically.
